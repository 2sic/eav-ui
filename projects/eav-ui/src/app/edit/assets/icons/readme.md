# Icons for eav-edit UI

We use Material Icons for almost everything, but some images are missing. This folder contains the custom icons we need. 

In the output they are inlined into Angular app, so they are not distributed as own files. 

## Folders / Structure

1. 2sxc: icons we made ourselves
1. font-awesome: icons from Font Awesome 5
