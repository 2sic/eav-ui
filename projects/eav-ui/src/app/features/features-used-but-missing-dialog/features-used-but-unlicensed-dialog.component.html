    <p>
      99% of all features in 2sxc are free. But some very advanced features are only for patrons (supporters) and enterprise customers. You
      are permitted to try these features, but to really use them you must get a license.
    </p>
    <p>
      This message should remind you ðŸ˜‰ of that.
      <br />
      Please contact your account manager to get them licensed, or visit the
      <a href="https://patrons.2sxc.org/" target="_blank">patrons</a> to learn more.
    </p>
    <p>The following features are currently in preview:</p>
    @for (feature of features(); track feature.nameId) {
      <app-feature-details-dialog
        [specs]="{ feature: feature, showGuid: false, showStatus: true, showClose: false }"
      ></app-feature-details-dialog>
      <br />
    }
